Hello! My name is Brandon Seda, I am a graduate from Lehman College with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. 
I enjoy all things technology, and am currently learning web-development using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
I have previous experience using Java, Python and MySQL, but I always find myself trying to learn new things,
so I am knowledgeable in other languages like R, SQL and a little of Swift.

I can be reached at www.linkedin.com/in/Brandon-Seda or Brandonseda1996@gmail.com
